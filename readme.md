BBOS

im not going to walk you through setting up GCC, check osdev wiki

To get running easily, use the ./qemu.sh script to make and install, current only platform is i386, open debug easily with the ./gdb.sh script (only after making the whole project with ./qemu.sh or ./iso.sh).

Not much more to say, this is very early stages and a project I'm working on just to learn.
